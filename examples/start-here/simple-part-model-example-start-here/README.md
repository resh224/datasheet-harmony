## Overview
Provides a jumping off point to JSON-LD

## Important Terms

•	@context:  Maps terms to IRIs for semantic clarity and interoperability. For example, schema:name refers to schema.org’s definition of "name", while pm: denotes a hypothetical JEDEC JEP30 PartModel namespace.

•	@type:  Declares this object as a Part according to the PartModel.

•	name/description:
Human-readable identifiers and specifications for the part.

•	mpn:  The manufacturer's part number, a key identifier in JEP30.

•	manufacturer:  Nested object describing the manufacturer, including a unique ID.

•	partType/package/status:  Additional structured attributes commonly found in JEP30 part models (e.g., part type, package code, lifecycle status).
 
Alignment with JEDEC JEP30
•	Manufacturer and MPN:
JEP30 defines a clear linkage between manufacturer identity and part numbers, as shown in the example.

•	Part Details:
The structure supports extension to include further details such as electrical, thermal, environmental, and supply chain sections, as described in JEP30F.

•	Extensibility:
JSON-LD enables the addition of digital signatures, references, and technical attributes as needed for compliance and interoperability.
